# Updated-Portfolio-Page
## Description
I made this site for the University of Richmond Bootcamp. The goal is to create a My portfolio site. I utilized HTML,CSS and javaScript to create my portfolio website. I had to follow a specific style and specifications. I deployed using Github Pages.

As a web developer, I need to a portfolio site deployed that will show my skills to potential employers and clients to hire me. This site also gives me an opportunity to introduce myself, while also providing a way for employers and clients to reach out to me.
